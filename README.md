Purpose

This lab environment has been deliberately designed as both a technical proving ground and a personal growth accelerator. Its primary purpose is to deepen my expertise across several interrelated domains that are critical to modern enterprise IT operations:

  ‚Ä¢	Secure network infrastructure ‚Äî designing, segmenting, and defending multizone networks with layered controls.
  ‚Ä¢	Virtualization and containerization ‚Äî orchestrating workloads across hypervisors and container platforms.
  ‚Ä¢	Linux and Windows server deployment and administration ‚Äî building, hardening, and maintaining heterogeneous systems in a unified operational model.
  ‚Ä¢	Enterprise grade application hosting ‚Äî deploying, integrating, and securing the same classes of tools and services found in production corporate environments.

This solution overview captures the current state of that environment, detailing the key technologies deployed and the security measures implemented.

The accompanying Security Hardening Checklist provides a structured view of the controls in place to ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability, and operational resilience.
The lab is built on the following guiding principles:

  ‚Ä¢	Defense in Depth ‚Äî multiple, complementary layers of security to reduce the likelihood and impact of compromise.
  ‚Ä¢	Secure by Design ‚Äî embedding security considerations into every architectural and configuration decision.
  ‚Ä¢	Zero Trust ‚Äî verifying every request, enforcing least privilege access, and minimizing implicit trust between systems.

By applying these principles consistently, I‚Äôve strengthened not only the technical posture of the lab but also my own capabilities in architecting, securing, and operating complex systems.

This growth is reflected in the breadth of technologies integrated here ‚Äî from identity aware reverse proxies and PKI infrastructure to high availability firewalls, vulnerability scanning, and digital forensics tooling.

Security Hardening Checklist

A comprehensive summary of hardening measures implemented across the lab environment to ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability, and operational resilience.

üîê Network & Perimeter Security
  ‚Ä¢	Network Segmentation & Rules-Based Access Control. 
  Implemented via pfSense firewalls to isolate services by trust level (e.g., DMZ, internal, management). VLANs and firewall rules restrict lateral movement and enforce least privilege.
  
  ‚Ä¢	High Availability Firewall Cluster. 
  pfSense VMs configured in HA pair with XMLRPC sync for rules, aliases, and state tables. Ensures uninterrupted routing and inspection during failover.
  
  ‚Ä¢	Inline Intrusion Detection & Prevention (IDS/IPS). 
  Suricata and Snort deployed in IPS mode on pfSense to inspect traffic in real time, block known threats, and log suspicious patterns for forensic analysis.
  
  ‚Ä¢	Network and Host Vulnerability Scanning
  OpenVAS deployed in Docker with custom port mapping and feed synchronization. Used to scan internal subnets and hosts for exposed services, outdated software, and misconfigurations. Results feed into asset lists.


üßë‚Äçüíº Identity & Access Management
  ‚Ä¢	Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) & Single Sign-On (SSO)
  Authentik provides OAuth2/OIDC flows across services, enforcing MFA and centralized identity verification. 
  
  ‚Ä¢	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). 
  Authentik and Active Directory enforce granular access policies across dashboards, containers, and infrastructure components.
  
  ‚Ä¢	PKI Infrastructure 
  StepCA deployed with an offline Root CA and online Intermediate CA for issuing service certificates. Fullchain delivery and trust propagation automated across nodes and containers.

üåê Web & Application Security
  ‚Ä¢	Secure Web Access (HTTPS/TLS) 
  All services exposed via Traefik reverse proxy with TLS termination. Services without native HTTPS are secured via proxy-to-client encryption.
  
  ‚Ä¢	ForwardAuth Middleware 
  Traefik integrates with Authentik outposts for identity-aware routing and header injection, enabling SSO and access control at the edge.
  
  ‚Ä¢	Secure Headers & IP Whitelisting

üß† DNS & Name Resolution
  ‚Ä¢	DNS Filtering & Conditional Forwarding 
  Pi-hole blocks known ad/tracking domains. Conditional forwarding routes internal domains to Bind9 for authoritative resolution.
  
  ‚Ä¢	Recursive DNS via Unbound 
  Unbound resolves queries directly from root servers, bypassing third-party resolvers for privacy and integrity.
    
  ‚Ä¢	Encrypted DNS 
  DNSSEC enabled to validate authenticity of DNS responses and prevent spoofing.
  
  ‚Ä¢	High Availability DNS 
  Dual Pi-hole containers run in separate Docker instances with sync via Nebula, ensuring redundancy and consistent policy enforcement.
